BaseX Meta
==============

This is the one-size-fits-all metapackage to build various parts of the BaseX distribution.

It depends on the following projects:

* BaseX (the main project)
* BaseX Extended Tests (stress tests etc.)
* BaseX API (xqj etc.)
* BaseX Dist (distribution files)

Ideally, depending on your platform, `mvn package` does the following:

* Runs the extended test suite against your distribution
* Windows Installer / Executable
* Zip Archive
* Mac OS X Disk Image


For Questions or Feedback - both is very welcome - feel free to use the Tracker or our [Mailinglist](http://basex.org/open-source/ "BaseX | Open Source").

Thanks.
